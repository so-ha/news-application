      "body": "More article by this Writer\nFinance Minister Hong Nam-ki (Yonhap)\nSouth Koreas Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki on Friday voiced opposition to a new round of COVID-19 emergency cash handouts for all nationals, promoted by the ruling Democratic Party and the government.\nIt is inappropriate to hand out emergency relief funds to people in the upper income brackets. The US government doesnt even offer tax rebates for the upper class, Hong said at the National Assemblys Strategy and Finance Committee meeting.\nSpending money to support small merchants and businesses most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic seems much more reasonable.\nThe DP and the government are currently in talks to submit this years second supplementary budget in July, estimated to reach somewhere between 30 trillion won ($29 billion) and 35 trillion won, to fight COVID-19.\nThe DP has been looking to dole out universal stimulus checks before the Chuseok holiday under the extra budget.\nWhile not considering cash grants to all residents, the government is discussing ways with the ruling party to broaden the range of recipients as a way to support its expansionary fiscal policy, Hong added.\nMeanwhile, the fiscal chief raised concerns over a possible rate hike, saying if the central bank raises the benchmark interest rate, debt burdens of households and companies will sharply increase.\nHongs remark came after Bank of Korea Gov. Lee Ju-yeol on Thursday suggested the possibility of a rate hike.\nThe current pandemic-era monetary easing is extremely dovish compared with the state of the economy. It is necessary to normalize monetary policy at an appropriate time by the end of the year, Lee said during a press briefing.\nConcerns are rising over a discord between the governments financial and monetary policy as the two economic policymakers expressed conflicting stances on monetary policy.\nThe Ministry of Economy and Finance and the BOK share roles to promote a balance between the two policy directions. We will try our best to prevent policy discord, Hong said.\nBy Choi Jae-hee (",

REUTERS/Niharika Kulkarni\n26 Jun 2021 12:24AM\nShare this content\nBookmark\nMUMBAI: India's richest state on Friday (Jun 25) ordered malls and cinema halls to close as it scrambles to control a more transmissible variant of the coronavirus that has scuppered plans to ease lockdown measures.\nAt least 20 cases in Maharashtra state have been found linked to the new Delta Plus variant that India designated a variant of concern on Tuesday, according to the health ministry.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nWhile it is not known where the variant originated, Public Health England first reported on Delta Plus in a June 11 bulletin, calling it a sub-lineage of the Delta variant first detected in India last year.\nThe Delta variant was partly responsible for a ferocious second wave in India that triggered a flood of cases and overwhelmed the health system.\nScientists fear Delta Plus could trigger another wave of infections as India recovers from the second wave. Many states, including Maharashtra, have been easing lockdown rules imposed in April.\n\"Positivity rate and daily infections were going down consistently until a week ago, but in some regions again cases have started to rise,\" a senior government official in Maharashtra told Reuters, declining to be named.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\n\"We don't know whether this is due to easing restrictions or the new variant, but this is a concern,\" the official added.\nIndia says new 'Delta plus' COVID-19 variant is a concern\nAt least 11 other countries have reported cases of Delta Plus.\nNew variants are a concern in India, where more than half the population is still not vaccinated. Only about 5.6 per cent of India's adult population of 950 million has received two doses.\nAdvertisement\nThe country has reported 48 cases of Delta Plus, and studies are ongoing to test the effectiveness of existing vaccines against the variant.\n\"We should have the results in about 7 to 10 days time whether the vaccine is working against the Delta Plus,\" said Balram Bhargava, head of the Indian Council of Medical Research.\nIn Maharashtra, a state of around 126 million people, only around 30 million have received a first dose.\n\"If citizens start doing business and crowding places without following guidelines, then infections may increase ... local authorities should not open businesses in a hurry,\" the state's Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said.\nIndia reported 51,667 new infections and 1,329 deaths on Friday, taking total infections to 30.13 million with 393,310 deaths.",

In a statement to the media after visiting the IAC at Ernakulam wharf of the Cochin port to review its construction progress, Singh described it as India's pride and a shining example of Atmanirbhar Bharat. Let us take a look at some of the images:\n\"Commissioning of the IAC next year will be a befitting tribute to 75 years of India's independence\", Rajnath Singh said in the statement read out to the media. (Image: Indian Navy)\nThe project was originally approved by the NDA government and has made significant progress in recent past despite COVID. (Image: Indian Navy)\nThe minister said it was a pleasure to review first-hand, the work being done on the Indigenous Aircraft Carrier. (Image: Indian Navy)\nRajnath said the IAC boasts of nearly 75 per cent indigenous content, from design, to steel used in construction, to key weapons and sensors. (Image: Indian Navy)\nThe Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) has also recently accorded approval for RFP of Project 75-I under the Strategic Partnership model, which will give further fillip to indigenous development of niche manufacturing technologies, the Minister said. (Image: Indian Navy)\nSingh said the Indian Navy remains poised and combat ready to tackle any challenge. (Image: Indian Navy)\nHe said the Navy has also made significant contributions in the fight against COVID, bringing back Indian citizens from overseas during Op Samudra Setu-I, and much needed Liquid Medical Oxygen during Samudra Setu-lI, despite dangers of COVID spread onboard warships. (Image: Indian Navy)\nThe IAC-1 before getting inducted in the Navy has to undergo a series of sea trials before it gets commissioned.

Some answers have been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.\nGet out, and enjoy every bit of life, it just may disappear in the blink of an eye.  Maureen Vanderbilt\nIt has taught me the lesson that nothing is permanent, patience and to plan ahead for a situation like this.  Ivan Ruz\nI know now that, if I get a cold or flu, Ill wear a mask so I dont spread my germs and snot on everybody.  Steven McElyea\nIt has not changed my plans for the future. Why would I have to worry about things not in my job description to control.  Fred Yakel\nHas not changed it at all.  Terry Dillman\nRight now, Im in a state of waiting! Waiting until the U.S. finally lifts the ridiculous travel ban from Europe. Thats all I can do right now. My life changed to a state of waiting.  Angela Brauchle\nIt has reconnected me with nature. Instead of going to crowded events and eating in restaurants, I now hit the road on my motorcycle and cruise rural areas and small towns. Go fishing, hunting, and camping. Havent been back to restaurants yet and when I start back, it will be very sparingly. Dont know if I will ever do cruises again. Will not do sporting events unless its with a small group in a skybox.  Tony Williams\nI am living YOLO.  Olga Ramirez\nIt has made me realize even more not to take anything for granted. Especially summer activities: festivals, going out, eating out, grilling more, etc. Summer is way too short here in the Midwest regardless. If youre lucky, you can have six decent months. Not wasting them anymore.  Brice Notardonato Ellett\nIn This Stream",

      "body": ",\nJune 25, 2021\n/PRNewswire/ -- New data show that the incidence and acuity of type 2 diabetes in children increased significantly during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, with more pediatric patients hospitalized from March to\nDecember 2020\ncompared to the same time period in 2019. Findings from the retrospective chart review were presented as a late-breaking poster session at the virtual 81\nst\nScientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association\n\n(ADA).\nDr. Daniel S. Hsia presents findings at the virtual 81st Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association.\nStay-at-home orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated risk factors for type 2 diabetes, including limiting physical activity, increasing screen time and sedentary behaviors, disturbing sleep, and increasing the intake of processed foods, which can all lead to weight gain. In fact, more than one in fourAmericans with diabetes report the pandemic disrupted their ability to obtain healthy fooda concerning trend as modest weight gain over a short period of time can increase the risk for long-term consequences such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. There is a lack of data on the incidence or severity of new-onset type 2 diabetes in the pediatric population during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe study compared the number and the acuity of hospitalizations for type 2 diabetes in children from March to\nDecember 2019\nand the same period in 2020 at Our Lady of the Lake Children's Hospital in\nBaton Rouge, LA\n.\nThe data analysis showed:\nIn 2019, the hospitalization rate for new onset type 2 diabetes was 0.27% (8 cases out of 2,964 hospitalizations) compared to 0.62% (17 out of 2,729) in 2020.\nChildren admitted to the hospital in 2020 had more severe diabetes with higher blood glucose, higher A1C (a marker of blood sugar over three months), and higher indicators of dehydration compared to children admitted in 2019.\nMore children in 2020 also presented with serious conditions that typically require admission to the intensive care unit compared to 2019 like diabetic ketoacidosis (eight vs. three) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome (two vs. zero).\n23 of 25 children were African American and 19 children were male.\n\"While our study examined hospital admissions for type 2 diabetes in children at one center, the results may be a microcosm of what is happening at other children's hospitals across the country,\" said\nDaniel S. Hsia M.D\n., Associate Professor at Pennington Biomedical Research Center in\nBaton Rouge, LA\n, and lead author of the study. \"Unfortunately, COVID-19 disrupted our lives in more ways than we realize. Our study reinforces the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle for children even under such difficult circumstances.\"\nResearch presentation details:",
